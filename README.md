# Cloud Sandbox
This monolithic repository contains mini-projects that I've done to explore various cloud platforms and tools. It is some sort of a personal [home lab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction), but in the cloud. 

Feel free to reuse some of it for your own projects.

## Projects
1. [AWS Jenkins](aws-jenkins/README.md) - quick setup of Jenkins in AWS EC2 using terraform
2. [K8s Elasticsearch](k8s-elasticsearch/README.md) - out-of-the-box Elasticsearch cluster with Kibana using Kubernetes
